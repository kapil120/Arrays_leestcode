Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

 



The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

 

Example:

Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49

Solution:

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        ans=0
        width=len(height)-1
        i=0
        j=len(height)-1
        while i<j:
            min1=min(height[i],height[j])
            currans=width*min1
            ans=max(ans,currans)
            if height[i]>height[j]:
                j=j-1
            else:
                # height[i]<height[j]
                i=i+1
            width=width-1
        return ans
